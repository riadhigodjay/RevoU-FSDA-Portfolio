This is a **GROUP FINAL PROJECT** I did with my team for the last assignment at RevoU Full Stack Data Analytics.

### Overview: 
The World Happiness Report (WHR) is a United Nations publication that ranks happiness from 1 to 10  in 149 countries (UN). 
The survey is based on how satisfied citizens perceive themselves to be. 
The life factor variables used in the reports reflect determinants that explain national-level differences in life evaluations found in the research literature.
