This project is designed to assess my understanding about the metrics from an application event journey.

Overview : 
In this case study, I play the role of a Data Analyst at Gojek, and my manager has asked me to collaborate with a Product or Business Team to dissect metrics for experimentation in the app's customer journey.

Things I need to do:
1. Select a specific custom journey to see the UI/UX of the app.
2. Take a screenshot of the customer journey.
3. Specify the Event Name, Metrics/Data to track, and Example Values.
