This project is designed to assess my basic knowledge of statistics and spreadsheet.

Overview:
In this study case, you work as a data analyst for ABC Company, a Malaysian property listing company. The objective of the company is to present their users with a variety of available property options. They provide property listings in and around Kuala Lumpur and other major cities in Malaysia. 
As a data analyst for this company, you are expected to provide insights that will help the company optimize profits while also assisting users and tenants. The corporation generates profits through a 20% profit-sharing arrangement. It means that the most expensive property generates the greatest percentage of revenue for the company. However, the limitation usually occurs when a high-priced property is difficult to sell because it has too many rooms or the room size is too large.
